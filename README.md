# A demo showing WASM component model resources in various environments

## Prerequisites

Rust target wasm32-wasi:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

CMake

cpetig/wit-bindgen:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cpetig/wit-bindgen.git
cd wit-bindgen
cargo install --path .
```

## Working

| |Guest|Host|
|---|---|---|
|C|✅ wit-bindgen|see below[^1]|
|C++|🚧 cpetig/wit-bindgen|🚧 cpetig/wit-bindgen + WAMR|
|Rust|✅ wit-bindgen|✅ wasmtime [^6]|
|JavaScript|🚧 [^5] |✅ jco [^6]|
|Go|☁️ [^3]| ? |
|Python|🚧 [^4]|🚧 [^4] |

## Compiling and Running

```bash
cd guest-rust
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release

cd ../host-wamr
./generate.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./executor
```

Expected Output:

`drop with value 34`

### C guest

Prerequisite: wasi-SDK

```bash
cd guest-c
./generate.sh
make
cd ..
ln -sf guest-c/guest-c.wasm guest.wasm 
```

### Wasmtime host

You need a preview1 adapter matching the wasmtime version, see 
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases for the 
command adapter downloads. 

But most likely you will need to check out the exact same wasmtime 
used for the host and build the adapter:
```bash
cd wasmtime/crates/wasi-preview1-component-adapter
cargo build -p wasi-preview1-component-adapter --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --features command --no-default-features
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm …/resource-demo/host-wasmtime

```

## Other environments

### Host languages

- Rust:

    Wasmer bindgen only supports the old witx, not the newer wit format. You could write a host binding generator within wit-bindgen though.

[^1]: Currently I generate C++ host bindings for WAMR, C would be feasible.

- Python: https://pypi.org/project/componentize-py/ (?)

[^6]: JCO and wasmtime currently need a different preview1 to preview2 adapter version

### WASI preview2 adapter

The wasmtime host requires wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm from ([the dev branch](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/dev/wasi_snapshot_preview1.command.wasm)) (WASI has recently migrated to resources)

JCO's preview2 browser shim still needs the older
[adapter](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/v12.0.1/wasi_snapshot_preview1.command.wasm) 

### Guest languages

[^5]: Jco likely needs the unfinished https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js/tree/resources for resource support in guests

JavaScript: 
    https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy is potentially smaller than spidermonkey embedded by jco, you will need another tool to generate guest bindings for imported functions, IIRC. A path using C bindings with yet to be written JavaScript wrapping should be viable.

[^4]: Python: https://pypi.org/project/componentize-py/ recently gained resource support

[^3]: Go: WIT bindgen support is [being worked on](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/SIG-Guest-Languages/blob/main/docs/subgroups.md)
